# Payoneer-Refund-Policy

The entire amount will be refunded if I can’t manage schedules after accepting a project.
I accept payment by milestones, there will be no refund for milestones completed (as agreed by the client).
If I can not finish the project within deadline, the client can ask for refund of the current milestone and they can end the contract
